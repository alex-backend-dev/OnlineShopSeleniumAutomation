Automate five test cases

Technology stack

· Programming language – C#
· Testing framework – NUnit
· Browser Automation – Selenium WebDriver
· Reporting – Allure framework

Tasks:

· Automate 5 test cases, which are described above

· Tests from one test class should be executed in one browser (if 3 test classes – browser should be opened 3 times, before each test class, not before each test method)

· Required patterns: Page Object; Optional: Singleton, Strategy (You can add more, if needed)

· If your project will contain DDT - store datasets in txt/xml/json files

· Project should be placed on GitHub or Bitbucket

· Tests should work in Chrome and Firefox

· Add switch in your code to run tests locally/ using Selenoid/SauceLabs (you may to do it by using “switch to” C# construction at your web driver generation code layer)

· If some test fails, attach screenshot, date and time, browser, platform version to your report

· Add cleanup to remove created data and grab info about running tests (add attachments)
